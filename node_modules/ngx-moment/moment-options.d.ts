     * relativeTimeThresholdOptions
     * @description Provides the `relativeTimeThreshold` units allowing a pipe to set the `moment.relativeTimeThreshold` values.
     * The `key` is a unit defined as one of `ss`, `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `M`.
     * @see https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/relative-time-threshold/
     * @example by default more than 45 seconds is considered a minute, more than 22 hours is considered a day and so on.
     * So settings the unit 'm' to `59` will adjust the `relativeTimeThreshold` and consider more than 59 minutes
     * to be an hour (default is `45 minutes`)
